📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow, starting from loading raw data in Python to delivering meaningful business insights through a Power BI dashboard.
The project focuses on data exploration, cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive visualization to support data-driven decision-making.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured business data used for analysis and reporting.

Loaded and processed using Python.

Stored in MySQL Server for querying and analysis.

Cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

(Dataset source can be mentioned here if applicable)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn) – Data loading, EDA, and cleaning

MySQL Server – SQL queries and data analysis

Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

Jupyter Notebook – Python analysis environment

🔄 Project Workflow / Steps

Data Loading

Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.

Verified schema, data types, and initial structure.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed data distributions and trends.

Identified outliers, missing values, and patterns.

Generated summary statistics and visualizations.

Data Cleaning

Handled missing and null values.

Removed duplicates and corrected data types.

Standardized columns for consistency.

SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Loaded cleaned data into MySQL Server.

Wrote SQL queries for:

Aggregations and filtering

KPI calculations
