📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project | Python, SQL, Power BI
🔍 Project Overview

This project showcases a complete end-to-end data analytics pipeline, covering data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard development using Power BI.

The goal of this project is to transform raw data into actionable business insights and present them through a clean, interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making.

🧠 Business Problem

Organizations often work with raw, inconsistent, and fragmented data, making it difficult to:

Track key performance metrics

Identify trends and patterns

Make informed business decisions

Objective:
To analyze historical data, extract meaningful insights using Python and SQL, and deliver a Power BI dashboard that helps stakeholders monitor performance and trends efficiently.
