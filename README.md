# 📊 End-to-End Data Analytics Project | Python, SQL, Power BI

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete **end-to-end data analytics workflow**, starting from raw data ingestion to delivering actionable insights through an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
It highlights strong skills in **Python, SQL, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization**, aligned with real-world business requirements.

---

## 🧠 Business Problem
Organizations often face challenges working with **raw and inconsistent data**, making it difficult to:
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Identify trends and patterns
- Make data-driven business decisions

**Objective:**  
To clean, analyze, and transform raw data using **Python and SQL**, and present meaningful insights through a **Power BI dashboard** that supports effective decision-making.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Structured business dataset used for analytical purposes
- Loaded and processed using **Python (Pandas)**
- Stored and queried using **MySQL Server**
- Cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies

*(Dataset source can be added if public)*

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL (MySQL Server)**
- **Power BI** (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
### 1. Data Loading
- Imported raw data into Python using Pandas
- Reviewed schema, data types, and data quality

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated descriptive statistics
- Identified trends, patterns, and outliers
- Created visualizations for better understanding

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing and null values
- Removed duplicate records
- Standardized column formats and data types

### 4. SQL Analysis (MySQL Server)
- Loaded cleaned data into MySQL
- Wrote optimized SQL queries using:
  - `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`
  - Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
  - Filtering and conditional logic
- Calculated business KPIs

### 5. Power BI Dashboard
- Connected Power BI to MySQL Server
- Built data models and relationships
- Created interactive visuals, slicers, and KPI cards
- Designed a clean and business-friendly dashboard

---

## 📊 Key KPIs
- Total records / transactions
- Category-wise and time-based performance
- Trend and growth analysis
- High-performing vs low-performing segments

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
- Interactive slicers for dynamic filtering
- KPI cards for quick performance monitoring
- Trend analysis using charts and tables
- Professional layout suitable for stakeholders

*(Add dashboard screenshots or Power BI Service link if available)*

---

## 🧪 Results & Insights
- Converted raw data into structured, analysis-ready format
- Identified key trends and performance metrics
- Delivered an interactive Power BI dashboard
- Improved reporting and data visibility for decision-making
